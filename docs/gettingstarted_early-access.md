Camunda Cloud private beta was released in September 2019. In this phase users had to be invited to use Camunda Cloud. In January 2020 the public beta was launched. Anybody who's interested can register for Camunda Cloud [here](https://accounts.cloud.camunda.io/signup).

Since CamundaCon Live in April 2020 we are offering an Early Access for interested users. In general, everyone receives a Free Plan, which makes it possible to create one Development Cluster. Interested users can switch to an [Early Access Plan](./earlyaccess_getting-started.md), with which several clusters can be created in different sizes.

The following rules apply for the Early Access phase:

- **Every user can create a cluster and use it without restrictions.** We reserve the right to delete clusters that are not used (only for Free Plan users).
- **Errors and features:** We're still in a beta phase and erros can happen. Please contact us if errors occur or if you miss features. For this we have a bug queue and a slack channel.
- **Not ready for production:** We can't guarantee that data might not be lost or a cluster has to be rebuilt. Should this happen, we will of course contact you in advance.
