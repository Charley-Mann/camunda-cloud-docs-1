Camunda Cloud private beta was released in September 2019. In this phase users had to be invited to use Camunda Cloud.

In January 2020 the public beta was launched. Anybody who's interested can register for Camunda Cloud [here](https://accounts.cloud.camunda.io/signup).

The following rules apply for the public beta:

- **Every user can create a cluster and use it without restrictions.** We reserve the right to delete clusters that are not used.
- **Errors and features:** We're still in a beta phase and erros can happen. Please contact us if errors occur or if you miss features. For this we have a bug queue and a slack channel.
- **Not ready for production:** We can't guarantee that data might not be lost or a cluster has to be rebuilt. Should this happen, we will of course contact you in advance.
