September 2019 Camunda Cloud was announced and thus the private beta was started. In this phase users had to be invited to use Camunda Cloud.

In January 2020 the public beta was launched. Everyone interested can register for Camunda Cloud [here](https://accounts.cloud.camunda.io/signup).

The following rules apply for the Public Beta:

- Every user can create a cluster and use it without restrictions. We reserve the right to delete clusters that are not used.
- Errors and features: Errors can happen, we are still in a beta phase. Please contact us if any errors occur or if you miss features. For this we have a bug queue and a slack channel.
- Not ready for production: We cannot guarantee that data will be lost or a cluster will have to be rebuilt. Should this happen, we will of course contact you in advance.
